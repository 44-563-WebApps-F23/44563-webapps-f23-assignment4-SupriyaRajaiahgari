    <h1>Supriya acts in
        a play</h1>
    <h3>The Master Builder by Henrik Ibsen</h3>
    <p>
        SOLNESS.<br>
        [Turns his head, and says in an off-hand tone of indifference:] Well, is
        that you?<br>

        <br>
        KAIA.<br>
        I merely wished to let you know that I have come.<br>

        <br>
        SOLNESS.<br>
        Yes, yes, that's all right. Hasn't Ragnar come too?<br>

        <br>
        KAIA.<br>
        No, not yet. He had to wait a little while to see the doctor. But he is
        coming presently to hear--<br>

        <br>
        SOLNESS.<br>
        How is the old man to-day?<br>

        <br>
        KAIA.<br>
        Not well. He begs you to excuse him; he is obliged to keep his bed
        to-day.<br>

        <br>
        SOLNESS.<br>
        Why, of course; by all means let him rest. But now, get to your work.<br>

        <br>
        KAIA.<br>
        Yes. [Pauses at the door.] Do you wish to speak to Ragnar when he comes?<br>

        <br>
        SOLNESS.<br>
        No--I don't know that I have anything particular to say to him.<br>

        [KAIA goes out again to the left. SOLNESS remains seated,
        turning over the drawings.<br>

        <br>
        MRS. SOLNESS.<br>
        [Over beside the plants.] I wonder if he isn't going to die now, as
        well?<br>
